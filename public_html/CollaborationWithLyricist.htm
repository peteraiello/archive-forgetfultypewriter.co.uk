<p style="margin-top:25px;">

I collaborated with my friend Harry because of his creative background as a writer/lyricist. He is also a musician with the band
<a href="http://adultjazz.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> Adult Jazz</a> and someone who&#39;s writing is influenced and inspired by creative typographic/text-based
experiments.
</p>

<p>
His writing background made him one of the more confident participants and our conversation
revolved around how the unique style he has cultivated, worked in relation to the different
interactions.
</p>

<p>
A feature of his writing process is what he describes as using the <q>two percent voice</q>
or <q>extreme voice</q>. He explained that this is the voice you think about things <q>two
percent of the time</q>, which is a highly emotive style, similar in nature to a rant. With
 minimal redrafting, certain lines are then extracted to form the lyrics of a song.
</p>

<p>
This style was explored using the programs and encompasses personal and creative forms of
writing. The immediate interactions (<b>FALL</b> and <b>FADE</b>) were favoured the most,
which among other things, made powerful dents in the emotionally charged writing. The captures of
 the deconstructed texts were referred to throughout our conversation, with extracts
 occasionally being read out loud in order to help contemplate and understand their meaning
  and how effectively the interactions work.
</p>



<!-- ***************************************************************************** TITLE: MAIN POINTS ********************************************************************************************* * -->

 <h2 style="color:#666362; text-align:left;margin-top:30px;">Main Points</h2>

 <div>
<a href="FALL_Example.htm" target="new">
<img src="images/lyrics_example.jpg" class="img_h" alt="FALL Example">
</a>
<p style="color:#000; font-family:  'Roboto',  Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:9pt;"><i>(FALL EXAMPLE)</i></p>
</div>

<p>
The visual processes of <b>FALL</b> can be used informally
 to reimagine and rephrase new or familiar work, such as poetry and lyrics. Writers can use the
  software to experiment with their prose and wording:
</p>

<blockquote>
&#34;There were lots of different arrangements of words from these lyrics that I was very familiar with and it breathed a new life in to them.&#34;
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, the <b>FALL</b> program can encourage the writer to use more descriptive language
 because of how the interaction works:
</p>


<blockquote>
&#34;You&#39;re keen to write interesting words because you want them to fall, and end up next to other interesting words.&#34;
</blockquote>

<p>This could help with the creative process of writers or be used in the context of education.</p>

<p class="cb2" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"></p>

<p>
With the <b>FADE</b> program, writing whilst the words disappear removes the user from the
constraint of perfection and craft. This could be used to aid the stream of consciousness
and detach the writer from the necessity of crafting a perfect piece of text:
</p>


<blockquote>
&#34;I did think it was more fun to write with the interaction on because you had to be really focused. I wasn&#39;t looking to create a whole piece&#34;
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, the disappearing words detach the user from feeling self-conscious.
It can detach the writer from caring about how they sound which could be beneficial for expression.
</p>


<blockquote>
&#34;It felt more like speaking than writing usually does because it goes...&#34;
</blockquote>

<p>
The other feature of the <b>FADE</b> program is it removes words to culminate in a disrupted
and partially concealed text. This was described as protective. The visual outcomes of
 the process can soften the harsh reality, which is beneficial for re-reading and sharing
 because  it allows for vulnerability without complete disclosure.
</p>


<blockquote>
&#34;This kind of thing is the real protection from the ultimate reality of what you wrote&#44; which might be quite real&#46; It&#39;s protective and defensive&#34;
</blockquote>

<p>
The significance of this in relation to the extreme voice was also commented on, stating that the use
of the software <q>Legitimates being emotional and writing emotionally.</q>
</p>
