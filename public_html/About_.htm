						<!--  memory and technology  -->

						<h2 class="grndrk">- Memory & Technology: Interweave</h2>
						<p>
						Technology is having transformative consequences on our relationship with memory. Contemporary
						concerns highlight the interwoven nature of memory and technology, and how strongly these two concepts
						are now connected. This was the original territory of the project, which includes the capacity for
						technology to feature as a surrogate for biological memory, as well as the problematic consequences
						of permanently archiving memories as digital data. A range of cultural responses are emerging to counteract
						these effects, including cognitive techniques to practice memory, as well as the concept of
						expiration  &#45; attaching times and dates to the lifespan of personal data.
						</p>

						<h2 class="bludrk">- Forgetful Typewriter</h2>
						<p>
						Inspired by the creative potential of this subject matter, this project progressed by translating
						this research into text-based experiments and developing prototypes for digital writing tools.
						Working in software culminated in a range of interactions for a text-editor that animatedly loses words.
						These programs are designed to resonate with themes of trust, loss and expiration, whilst finding new,
						meaningful contexts in personal forms of writing. This includes both expressive and creative, with user
						experiences that range from the playful to the therapeutic.
						</p>

						<!-- collaboration and development -->

						<h2 class="grydrk">- Collaboration & Development</h2>
						<p>
						Thus far the programs have primarily been tested with a student audience, in domestic and
						group settings. User testing has been initiated through a number of workshops and exercises run by me.
						Insightful responses and collaboration has been essential for developing the software and generating new ideas.
						User research has highlighted the potential of the device as both a creative and therapeutic tool.
