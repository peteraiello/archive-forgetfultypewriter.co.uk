<h1><b> Creative Writing Workshop </b> </h1>
<h2 style="color:#347235"> Initial User Testing for the Software </h2>

<img src="images/creativewritingworkshop.jpg" class="imgblog" alt="creative writing workshop">

<p>
I ran a small workshop using the software with a few students from the creative writing department.
 The participants used the sentiment program, and were guided through writing a short piece of expressive
 writing with a topic of their choice, without any prior knowledge of the nature of the interactions and what
 would happen. Here are a few key points:

<ul class="a">
<li class="a"> The interaction was uncontrolled, and programmed to occur four minutes into the writing process.
 Because each participant had started writing at roughly the same time, their noticing of the interaction was
  synchronised and caused a sense of surprise and some amusement.
</li>


<li class="a"> A concern was that the process of falling words would result in a form of disruption that
would undermine the value of using this software. However, it was observed that whilst the process of gradually
losing words resulted in pauses, it did not deter people from continuing writing.
</li>


<li class="a"> Participants were curious to understand more about what the interaction was,
such as emotion, and were surprised when it was revealed that it was negative. Only participant
 guessed this, and began to explore the interaction further, by purposefully using more negative words.
</li>

<li class="a"> The general consensus was that there was a therapeutic element to the interaction
and the empty spaces that were left behind in the text felt intuitively mysterious and this experience
could be expanded on.
</li>


<li class="a">Finally, a number of technical issues occurred. The participants sometimes missed the
 full impact of using the programs because the negative words were misspelled, or there was a comma
 at the end of the word and the delimiter only included spaces. This meant many words were not recognised by the system.
</li>

</ul>


<p>
<i class="a">
Note: This was the first time the software was properly tested by anyone. Now that the bugs have been fixed, it would be interesting to test the software again in a group context.
