<h1><b>- Collaboration with Lyricist</b> </h1>
<h2 style="color:#347235"><q> Legitmates being emotional and writing emotionally...</q></h2>

<!-- ***************************************************************************** MAIN CONTENT ********************************************************************************************* * -->

<p style="margin-top:25px;">
I collaborated with my friend Harry, the perfect person to participate with testing the software
because of his creative background as a writer/lyricist and musician for the band <a href="http://adultjazz.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> Adult Jazz</a>.
He is also someone who’s writing is influenced by creative typographic/text-based experiments.
</p>
<p>
His writing background made him one of the more confident participants and
our conversation revolved around how the unique style he has cultivated, worked in relation to the different interactions.
</p>
<p>
A feature of Harry’s writing process is what he describes as using the <q>two percent
voice</q> or <q>extreme voice</q>. He explained that this is the voice you think about things <q>two
percent of the time</q>, which is a highly emotive style, similar in nature to a rant. With minimal redrafting, certain lines are
then extracted to form the lyrics of a song.
</p>
<p>
This style was explored using the programs and encompasses personal and creative forms of writing. The immediate
 interactions (<b>FALL</b> and <b>FADE</b>) were favoured the most,
creating blank dents in Harry's emotionally charged writing. The captures of the deconstructed
texts were referred to throughout our conversation with Harry occasionally reading extracts out
 loud to help contemplate and understand their meaning and how effectively the interactions work.
</p>

<!-- ***************************************************************************** TITLE: MAIN POINTS ********************************************************************************************* * -->

 <h2 style="color:#666362; text-align:left;">Main Points</h2>
<p margin>
The visual processes of the <b>FALL</b> software can be used informally to
reimagine and rephrase new or familiar work, such as poetry and lyrics. Writers can use the
software to experiment with their prose and wording:
</p>
<blockquote>
“… There were lots of different arrangements of words from these lyrics that I was very familiar
with and it breathed a new life in to them.”
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the <b>FALL</b> program can encourage the writer to use more descriptive language
because of how the interaction works. This could help with the creative process of writers or
 be used in the context of education:
</p>

<blockquote>
“… You’re keen to write interesting words because you want them to fall, and end up next to other interesting words.”
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
With the <b>FADE</b> program, writing whilst the words disappear removes the user from the constraint of perfection and craft.
 This aids the stream of consciousness and detaches the writer from the necessity of crafting a perfect piece of text:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I did think it was more fun to write with the interaction on because you had to be really focused.
 I wasn’t looking to create a whole piece…”
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, the disappearing words detach the user from feeling self-conscious.
It detaches the writer from caring about how they sound whilst remaining an authentic form of expression:
</p>

<blockquote>
“It felt more like speaking than writing usually does because it goes...”
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, the obscuration of the text both conceals and protects the user, allowing for vulnerability
when re-reading or sharing. The way in which the interaction creates gaps can be used to
protect the reader from the harsh reality:</p>
<blockquote>
“This kind of thing is the real protection from the ultimate reality of what you wrote,
which might be quite real… It’s protective and defensive…”
</blockquote>

<p>
Harry stated the significance of this in relation to the extreme voice and also commented
 on how use of the software <q>Legitimates being emotional and writing emotionally.</q>
 </p>

<p style="font-family:'Roboto'; margin-bottom:20px;">
<i><b>User testing has helped enrich the research in the context of writing practices and personal
forms writing whilst demonstrating how writers can use the features of the software intuitively
with their own unique style and voice.
